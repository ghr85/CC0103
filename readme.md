# Codeclan Week 01 Day 03

## Arrays, Hashes & Loops

This is the homework exercise given after an intense day of learning
about data structures and loops.You are given a series of data structures and
asked to interrogate them in various manners.

## Notes
* This exercise came at the end of a long day. While the concepts individually were
understandable, combined & applied was a new beast. No time to rest on the laurels.


* Keep an eye out for arrays within hashes. Take it slow and follow it down.


* We haven't touched code blocks yet
